The purpose of pattern FACTORY METHOD is to 
introduce an abstract method of creating an object by referring to concrete subclasses the actual creation.

The pattern is used in the following cases:
1/ A class knows only the abstract classes of the objects with which it has relations.
2/ A class wants to transmit to its subclasses instantiation sprouts by taking advantage of the polymorphism.
